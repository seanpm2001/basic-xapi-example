# Integrating the xAPI Wrapper in Web Content

## Overview
This project is a very simple example of using the xAPI Wrapper 
downloaded from [Veracity Learning](https://lrs.io). Each LRS 
provides a page to download a preconfigured xAPI Wrapper to use 
in web content. This example project demonstrates how to include 
the xAPI Wrapper in HTML, and how to send 'Initialized' and 
'Terminated' statements to the Veracity Learning LRS.    

## Structure
This example contains the following files:
* index.html - HTML file containing example javascript code using the xAPI Wrapper  
* LICENSE - Apache 2.0 license
* README - This file

## Use
See [Veracity Learning's](https://lrs.io) 'Getting Started' pages for 
more detailed information on using this example.  
  
In a nutshell:  
* Download the configured xAPI Wrapper from [Veracity Learning](https://lrs.io)
* Place the xAPI Wrapper at the same location as this project's `index.html`
* Open `index.html` in a browser
